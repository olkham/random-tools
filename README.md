# random-tools
A collection of random tools and helpers I use across my personal projects - basically I don't recommend anyone use these :D
There are no tests, snippets can originate from Stack Overflow to ChatGPT.
Nothing is optimised or documented.

**framesource.py**
Helper for grabbing frames from IP cameras on another thread. Some of my cameras close the stream if I didn't constantly pull frames.
There's some other functionality like handling a folder of images as a video, looping videos, and integrating a recording function - all of which I'm sure will break easily when presented with the slightest edge case...
